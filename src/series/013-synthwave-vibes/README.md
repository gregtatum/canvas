I decided I wanted to do a bit of fun 3d work. This rendering combines three.js with 2d canvas rendering.

### Credits

Inspiration for the piece comes from Dan McPharlin. I didn't really realize how close I got to the original until after I had finished it, so kudos to his work.

The 3d bits were built using [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js).
