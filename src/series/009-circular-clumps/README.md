In a further endeavor to create my own physics system, I started working on correctly modeling impulse colliision responses, where two bodies of different masses can collide with one another. It was a bit difficult to find correct implementations of the formula with adequate explanations. I ended up driving up to my office to grab a book on game mechanics to have a more reasonably written explanation. I was quite happy with the way that I was able to encode the math explanations into the comments.
